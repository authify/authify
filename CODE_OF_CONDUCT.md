# Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by this Code of Conduct. We expect all participants to help create a safe, positive, and productive environment for the community.

We follow the spirit of the **Contributor Covenant v2.1** with a focus on respect, inclusion, and security mindfulness.

## Our Pledge
We as members, contributors, and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment‑free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, experience level, education, socio‑economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion (or lack thereof), or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:
- Demonstrating empathy and kindness
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Providing constructive feedback
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Prioritizing security and privacy of users

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- Harassment or discrimination of any kind
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information (doxing)
- Conduct that could reasonably be considered disruptive, unethical, or unsafe

## Security Mindfulness
Because Authify is a security‑sensitive identity platform, discussions or contributions that intentionally weaken authentication, authorization, cryptographic guarantees, or multi‑tenant isolation are not acceptable. Always raise security concerns responsibly.

## Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct.

## Scope
This Code applies within all project spaces (repository, issues, discussions, pull requests, community chat) and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project.

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the maintainers at:

security@yourcompany.com

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

## Enforcement Guidelines
1. **Correction** – Private or public notice of unacceptable behavior
2. **Warning** – Official warning with consequences for continued behavior
3. **Temporary Ban** – Time‑limited exclusion from interaction
4. **Permanent Ban** – Permanent removal from community involvement

## Attribution
This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant version 2.1 (https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/).
