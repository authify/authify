## Technical Notes

- **Use TDD instead of manual `curl` testing** - Tests reveal issues faster and provide better debugging information
- Use `mix phx.gen` generators to scaffold resources
- Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for commit messages
- **Template error handling** - Use `Keyword.get_values/2` for changeset errors, not direct key access
- **Mixed key consistency** - Keep string vs atom keys consistent in params throughout the pipeline
- **Virtual fields in tests** - Compare specific fields rather than full structs to avoid virtual field mismatches
- **DO NOT COMMIT FAILING TESTS** - Seriously, if tests are failing or the project fails to compile, we're not ready to commit. All tests and style checks must pass before using `git` to commit changes. Use `mix test` or occasionally `mix precommit` to confirm tests pass and style adherence.
- **Treat warnings as failing tests** - When running `mix test`, any warnings (e.g., unused variables) should be considered failures and must be resolved before committing.
- **Finish the task at hand** - Even if it is complex or will be a lot of work, don't suggest stopping, taking a break, taking stock, or anything else to the user related to considering a partially completed task as completed and/or ready to commit. If the user wants to stop, that's fine, but there's no need to suggest it.

### Management API Architecture

- **Header-based versioning** - Uses `Accept: application/vnd.authify.v1+json` or defaults to `application/json` for latest version
- **HATEOAS/JSON:API compliance** - Responses include structured data, links, and metadata following JSON:API patterns
- **Pipeline**: Routes use `:management_api` pipeline with `ApiVersionNegotiation` and `APIAuth` plugs
- **Base controller**: All API controllers inherit from `AuthifyWeb.API.BaseController` for consistent formatting
- **Response structure**:
  ```json
  {
    "data": { "id": "...", "type": "...", "attributes": {...}, "links": {...} },
    "links": { "self": "..." },
    "meta": { "page": 1, "per_page": 25, "total": 100 }
  }
  ```
- **Error format**:
  ```json
  {
    "error": { "type": "...", "message": "...", "details": {...} },
    "links": { "documentation": "/developers/errors" }
  }
  ```

### Management API Development Requirements

**When adding or updating Management API endpoints, you MUST:**

1. **Write comprehensive tests** - Every endpoint requires full test coverage including:
   - Happy path scenarios for all HTTP methods
   - Error cases (404, 400, 422, 403, etc.)
   - Permission/authentication testing
   - Edge cases and validation scenarios

2. **Update API documentation** - All new endpoints must be documented with:
   - Request/response examples
   - Parameter descriptions
   - Error response formats
   - Authentication/permission requirements

3. **Review OAuth2 scopes and permissions** - Ensure appropriate scopes exist for:
   - Management API applications (`management_app:read`, `management_app:write`, etc.)
   - Personal Access Tokens
   - Different permission levels (admin vs user access)
   - Resource-specific scopes (`certificates:read`, `users:write`, etc.)

**API endpoints are not considered complete until all three requirements are satisfied.**

### API Documentation Locations

**OpenAPI Specification:**
- **Source File**: [lib/authify_web/controllers/api/docs_controller.ex](lib/authify_web/controllers/api/docs_controller.ex) (1975+ lines)
- **Runtime Spec Endpoint**: `GET /docs/openapi.json` (accessible at `http://localhost:4000/docs/openapi.json` in dev)
- **Runtime Interactive Endpoint**: `GET /docs/api` (accessible at `http://localhost:4000/docs/api` in dev)
- **Purpose**: Auto-generated OpenAPI 3.1.0 specification with deployment-specific URLs
- **Contains**: All Management API endpoints, schemas, parameters, authentication methods, and examples

**Human-Readable Documentation:**
- **README.md**: High-level overview, quick start guide, and common usage examples
- **Usage Examples**: Located in README under "Usage" section (lines 108-176)

**When updating the API:**
1. Add new endpoints to `docs_controller.ex` under the appropriate `build_*_paths()` function
2. Add new schemas to `build_schemas()` and create corresponding `build_*_schema()` functions
3. Update tags in `build_tags()` if adding a new resource category
4. Update README examples if the changes affect common use cases
